Add a paragraph to the editor with the class set to `padding` and set internal indents:

* 10 pixels at the top
* 15 pixels at the bottom
* 20 pixels left and right

Use the following text for the paragraph:

<div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
  <p class="m-0">What does a web designer do? They create pages using HTML and CSS. They can use the capabilities of Flex and Grid modules. They use the SASS preprocessor and the Pug templating engine, and builds projects with Gulp. They keep track of site accessibility by creating semantically correct markup. They create components and utilities on Bootstrap. They lay out adaptive projects.</p>
</div>

The text itself does not matter and won't be checked. The main purpose is to add text to be arranged in multiple lines. This will help you see the left and right indents correctly.

Add a black background to the paragraph and white text. Try different values for the `padding` property to see how it affects the block.

Write the styles in the `<style>` tag
